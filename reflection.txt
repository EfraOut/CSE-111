Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

The first time I was introduced to functions during this class, I was able to see how
it made the projects made in CSE 110 easier. Being able to see that, by using parameters,
you can reuse the same coding, allowing programs to be shorter and faster, was facinating.
A good experience I had with that was when I recreated a program made in CSE 110, but with functions.
That's when I saw the power of functions

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

For me, it will be the ability to keep the programmer in track and consceous of where their working.
Test functions allow the programmer to think, consider how to make a good function, and then applying it
by testing their logic. Without test functions, programmer can easily be lost with all the functions they
have to write.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

When I encounter a problem and I try to troubleshoot it, the first thing that I do is
read the error that the terminal dropped, then I start looking at my logic, trying to figure out when and
why did it crash, and make the changes I feel necessary. I repeat this process until I succeed or I give up
and use the debugger.
Something I can do to improve the process is use the debugger more often, and not only as a last resource
